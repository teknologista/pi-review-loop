# Pi Review Loop

Automated code review loop for [Pi coding agent](https://buildwithpi.ai/). Repeatedly prompts the agent to review its own work until it confirms no issues remain.

```
> /review-start

Review mode (1/7)  ← status appears in footer

[agent reviews, finds bug, fixes it]

Review mode (2/7)

[agent reviews again]

"No issues found."

Review mode ended: no issues found  ← auto-exits
```

Agents make mistakes. They miss edge cases, introduce typos, forget error handling. Asking them to review their own code catches a surprising number of issues, but you have to remember to ask, and then ask again if they found something. This automates that:

**Auto-Trigger** - Optionally detects phrases like "implement the plan" or the `/double-check` template. Disabled by default; enable with `/review-auto on` or in settings.

**Persistent Loop** - After each response, sends a review prompt. If the agent found and fixed issues, it loops again. Only exits when the agent genuinely finds nothing.

**Smart Exit Detection** - Won't be fooled by "Fixed 3 issues. No further issues found." Detects when issues were fixed and keeps looping.

**Fresh Context** - Optional mode that strips prior review iterations from context each pass. The agent is prompted to re-read any relevant plan, spec, or PRD documents, so it truly reviews with fresh eyes instead of through the lens of its previous passes.

**Fully Configurable** - Every pattern is customizable. Change what triggers the loop, what exits it, and what prompt gets sent. Extend the defaults or replace them entirely.

## Typical Workflow

The loop shines in two scenarios:

**Before implementing** — You've got a plan doc and want to sanity-check it against the actual codebase. Run `/review-plan` and let the agent compare the plan to what exists. It'll catch things like outdated assumptions, conflicting patterns, or unnecessary complexity. The funny thing is, it rarely finds everything on the first pass. Second pass catches different issues. Third pass, more still. That's the whole point of the loop.

**After implementing** — You just finished building a feature and want to catch bugs before calling it done. Run `/review-start` and the agent reviews its own work with fresh eyes. Typos, missed edge cases, forgotten error handling — it finds stuff you'd miss staring at the same code. Again, multiple passes tend to surface different issues each time.

The pattern is the same: keep reviewing until there's genuinely nothing left to find. The loop handles the "ask again" part automatically. You'll see `Review mode (2/7)` in the footer so you know it's working and how many passes it's done.

## Install

```bash
pi install npm:pi-review-loop
```

Restart pi to load the extension. On activation, you'll see status in the footer:

```
Review mode (2/7)
```

## Prompt Templates

The package includes two bundled prompt templates (no files are copied into `~/.pi/agent/`):

| Template | Command | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `double-check.md` | `/double-check` | Review code with fresh eyes, fix any issues found |
| `double-check-plan.md` | `/double-check-plan` | Review implementation plan against codebase |

These prompts are designed to work with the review loop:
- They instruct the agent to respond with "No issues found." when done (triggering exit)
- They tell the agent to end with "Fixed [N] issue(s). Ready for another review." when issues are fixed (continuing the loop)
- `double-check.md` includes the "fresh eyes" phrase that triggers the loop when `autoTrigger` is enabled

**Recommended workflow:** Use `/review-start` to activate review mode, which sends the review prompt automatically. Alternatively, enable auto-trigger (`/review-auto on`) and the `/double-check` template will activate the loop.

You can customize or replace these prompts, change trigger patterns, or use your own entirely. See [Configuration](#configuration). The agent can also start/stop the loop on demand via the `review_loop` tool. See [Tool API](#tool-api).

If you prefer editable local prompt files, copy them manually from `prompts/` into `~/.pi/agent/prompts/`.

## Quick Start

### Manual Activation

```
/review-start
```

Activates review mode and immediately sends the review prompt.

### Automatic Activation (Optional)

Auto-trigger is disabled by default. Enable it for the current session:

```
/review-auto on
```

Or permanently in `~/.pi/agent/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "reviewerLoop": {
    "autoTrigger": true
  }
}
```

With auto-trigger enabled, trigger phrases activate review mode:

```
> implement the plan
> implement the spec
> let's implement this plan
```

Or use the `/double-check` prompt template.

### Check Status

```
/review-status
```

Shows whether review mode is active and current iteration.

### Exit Early

```
/review-exit
```

Or just type something else. Any non-trigger input exits review mode.

### Adjust Iterations

```
/review-max 5
```

Changes max iterations for current session.

## Fresh Context

By default, each review iteration sees the full conversation history including all prior iterations. This means by pass 3, the agent is reviewing code through the lens of its two prior reviews -- not truly fresh eyes. Fresh context mode fixes this.

When enabled, prior review iterations are stripped from context before each LLM call. The agent only sees: the original pre-review conversation, a brief pass note instructing it to re-read any relevant plan/spec/PRD documents, and the current iteration's review prompt and tool usage.

### Enable Fresh Context

Per-session:
```
/review-fresh on
```

Or via the tool:
```typescript
review_loop({ start: true, freshContext: true })
```

Or permanently in settings:
```json
{
  "reviewerLoop": {
    "freshContext": true
  }
}
```

### How It Works

```
iteration 1: [pre-review context] [review prompt]                     ← full context
iteration 2: [pre-review context] [pass note] [review prompt]         ← iter 1 stripped
iteration 3: [pre-review context] [pass note] [review prompt]         ← iters 1-2 stripped
```

The pre-review context is everything from before review mode was activated. Within a review iteration, multi-turn tool usage (read, bash, edit) is preserved -- only completed prior iterations are stripped.

The pass note tells the agent which pass it's on and instructs it to re-read any relevant plan, spec, PRD, or progress documents before reviewing. This way the agent re-grounds itself in the source of truth each pass using its own tool calls rather than programmatic injection.

If auto-compaction fires during a review loop (large sessions), the fresh context handler gracefully degrades to full context for that session.

## Configuration

Configure in `~/.pi/agent/settings.json`. Works out of the box, but everything is customizable:

```json
{
  "reviewerLoop": {
    "maxIterations": 7,
    "autoTrigger": true,
    "freshContext": true,
    "reviewPrompt": "template:double-check",
    "triggerPatterns": {
      "mode": "extend",
      "patterns": ["execute the plan"]
    },
    "exitPatterns": {
      "mode": "extend",
      "patterns": ["ship it", "ready to merge"]
    },
    "issuesFixedPatterns": {
      "mode": "extend",
      "patterns": ["addressed the following"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `maxIterations` | Max review prompts before auto-exit (default: 7) |
| `autoTrigger` | Enable keyword-based auto-trigger (default: false) |
| `freshContext` | Strip prior iterations from context each pass (default: false) |
| `reviewPrompt` | The prompt to send each iteration |
| `triggerPatterns` | What activates review mode (requires autoTrigger: true) |
| `exitPatterns` | What indicates "review complete" |
| `issuesFixedPatterns` | What indicates issues were fixed (prevents false exits) |

### Review Prompt Sources

Three formats for `reviewPrompt`:

| Format | Example | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| Template | `"template:double-check"` | Loads `~/.pi/agent/prompts/double-check.md` |
| File | `"~/prompts/review.md"` | Loads from any file path |
| Inline | `"Review the code carefully..."` | Uses text directly |

Templates and files reload on each use. Edit them and changes take effect immediately.

### Pattern Configuration

Each pattern setting accepts:

```json
{
  "mode": "extend",
  "patterns": ["simple string", "/regex\\s+pattern/i"]
}
```

**Modes:**
- `"extend"` (default, recommended) - Add your patterns to the built-in defaults
- `"replace"` - Use only your patterns, discard defaults entirely

**Pattern formats:**
- Simple string → auto-escaped, case-insensitive literal match
- `/pattern/flags` → full regex with custom flags

**Why extend mode is recommended:** The built-in defaults use sophisticated regex patterns to handle edge cases (e.g., distinguishing "No issues found" from "Issues found and fixed"). If you use replace mode, you take full responsibility for handling these nuances. Extend mode lets you add simple patterns like `"ship it"` while the defaults handle the tricky stuff.

## Default Patterns

These are the built-ins (all customizable):

**Triggers:**
- "implement plan/spec", "implement the plan/spec"
- "start implementing", "let's implement", "go ahead and implement"
- `/double-check` template content

**Exit phrases:**
- "no issues found", "no bugs found"
- "looks good", "all good" (on own line)

**Issues-fixed indicators:**
- "fixed the following", "issues fixed", "bugs fixed"
- "Issues:", "Bugs:", "Changes:" (headers)
- "ready for another review"

## Exit Conditions

The loop exits when:

1. **Exit phrase without fixes** - Agent says "no issues" and didn't fix anything
2. **Max iterations** - Safety limit reached (default: 7)
3. **User interrupts** - You type something (only trigger phrases are ignored, and only when auto-trigger is on)
4. **Manual exit** - `/review-exit` command
5. **Abort** - Press ESC or agent response is empty

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/review-start` | Activate and send review prompt immediately |
| `/review-start <focus>` | Start review with custom focus (quotes optional) |
| `/review-plan` | Activate and review plans/specs/PRDs (uses `double-check-plan` template) |
| `/review-plan <focus>` | Review plan with custom focus (quotes optional) |
| `/review-exit` | Exit review mode |
| `/review-max <n>` | Set max iterations (session only) |
| `/review-auto [on\|off]` | Toggle auto-trigger from keywords (session only) |
| `/review-auto <focus>` | Enable auto-trigger AND start review with custom focus |
| `/review-fresh [on\|off]` | Toggle fresh context mode (session only) |
| `/review-status` | Show current state |

## Tool API

The `review_loop` tool lets the agent control review mode directly:

```typescript
// Check status (default)
review_loop({})

// Start review mode
review_loop({ start: true })

// Start with custom max iterations
review_loop({ start: true, maxIterations: 5 })

// Start with custom focus
review_loop({ start: true, focus: "focus on error handling and edge cases" })

// Stop review mode
review_loop({ stop: true })

// Just update max iterations
review_loop({ maxIterations: 10 })

// Enable/disable auto-trigger
review_loop({ autoTrigger: true })
review_loop({ autoTrigger: false })

// Enable fresh context
review_loop({ start: true, freshContext: true })
```

**Returns:**
```json
{
  "active": true,
  "currentIteration": 1,
  "maxIterations": 7,
  "autoTrigger": false,
  "freshContext": true,
  "focus": "focus on error handling",
  "message": "Review mode active: iteration 2/7"
}
```

**Mode priority:** `start` > `stop` > status (default)

## How It Works

```
input event
    ↓
autoTrigger on + matches trigger? → enter review mode
    ↓
agent responds
    ↓
agent_end event
    ↓
matches exit + no fixes? → exit review mode
    ↓
iteration < max? → send review prompt → loop
    ↓
otherwise → exit (max reached)
```

**Events used:**
- `session_start` - Reload settings
- `input` - Detect triggers (if autoTrigger enabled), handle interrupts
- `before_agent_start` - Check expanded prompts for triggers (if autoTrigger enabled)
- `context` - Strip prior iterations and inject pass note (if freshContext enabled)
- `agent_end` - Analyze response, decide to loop or exit

## Limitations

- **Template scope** - `template:name` loads from `~/.pi/agent/prompts/` first, then falls back to this package's bundled templates (`prompts/`), not project templates
- **Session-scoped settings** - `/review-max` and `/review-auto` don't persist across sessions (use settings.json for persistence)
- **Pattern failures are silent** - Invalid regex patterns are skipped without error
